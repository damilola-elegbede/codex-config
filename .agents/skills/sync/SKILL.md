description: Install this repository's owned Codex configuration into ~/.codex — staged, validated, backed up, atomic. Use after pulling main; --dry-run on a fleet node.

# /sync

Run from a clone of this repository that is current with `origin/main` (the
script refuses a stale or dirty tree):

```bash
scripts/sync.sh $ARGUMENTS
```

Flags: `--dry-run` (validate the staged result and print the diff, write
nothing), `--no-backup`, `--force`. Exit codes: 0 synced · 1 pre-flight ·
2 validation failed (live untouched) · 3 install or post-validate failed
(backup path printed).

What it owns: the manifest-listed top-level keys of `config.toml`
(`model`, `model_reasoning_effort`, `web_search`) and the profile files
`think|code|review.config.toml`. What it never touches: `[projects.*]`,
`[notice.model_migrations]`, `[tui.*]`, `auth.json`, `sessions/`,
`history.jsonl`, sqlite, `cache/`, `log/`, `plugins/`, `skills/.system`,
`rules/default.rules`, user skills. On a fleet node (Mac Mini) run
`--dry-run` first, then a `codex-review.sh` smoke, before a real sync.
